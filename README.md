# Clicker Class
Adds the 'Clicker Class', a joke set of weapons. Don't hurt yourself!

## Mod Compatibility
If you wish to add clicker related content in your own mod, head over to our [ClickerClassExampleMod](https://github.com/SamsonAllen13/ClickerClassExampleMod) repo.

## Localization
If you wish to contribute translations, visit the [tML wiki page](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Contributing-Localization) on that.
This mod uses `.lang` files in the `Localization` folder.
Yet untranslated lines are marked with a `# ` at the beginning. Remove it once you translated a line. Only translate the righthand side (after the `=`), and don't touch things inside curly brackets (`{ }`)!

Big thanks to jopojelly for providing the translation maintaining script.
